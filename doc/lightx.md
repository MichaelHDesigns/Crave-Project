##LightX Technical Information

LightX has been integrated into the Core Daemon in two ways:
* "push" notifications (ZMQ and `-lightxnotify` cmd-line/config option);
* RPC commands.

####ZMQ

When a "Transaction Lock" occurs the hash of the related transaction is broadcasted through ZMQ using both the `zmqpubrawtxlock` and `zmqpubhashtxlock` channels.

* `zmqpubrawtxlock`: publishes the raw transaction when locked via LightX
* `zmqpubhashtxlock`: publishes the transaction hash when locked via LightX

This mechanism has been integrated into Bitcore-Node-PHore which allows for notification to be broadcast through Insight API in one of two ways:
* WebSocket: [https://github.com/Crave-Project/insight-api-crave#web-socket-api](https://github.com/Crave-Project/insight-api-crave#web-socket-api) 
* API: [https://github.com/Crave-Project/insight-api-crave#lightx-transactions](https://github.com/Crave-Project/insight-api-crave#lightx-transactions) 

####Command line option

When a wallet LightX transaction is successfully locked a shell command provided in this option is executed (`%s` in `<cmd>` is replaced by TxID):

```
-lightxnotify=<cmd>
```

####RPC

Details pertaining to an observed "Transaction Lock" can also be retrieved through RPC, itâ€™s important however to understand the underlying mechanism.

By default, the Crave daemon will launch using the following constant:

```
static const int DEFAULT_LIGHTX_DEPTH = 5;
```

This value can be overridden by passing the following argument to the Crave daemon:

```
-lightxdepth=<n>
```

The key thing to understand is that this value indicates the number of "confirmations" a successful Transaction Lock represents. When Wallet RPC commands are performed (such as `listsinceblock`) this attribute is taken into account when returning information about the transaction. The value in `confirmations` field you see through RPC is showing the number of `"Blockchain Confirmations" + "LightX Depth"` (assuming the funds were sent via LightX).

There is also a field named `bcconfirmations`. The value in this field represents the total number of `"Blockchain Confirmations"` for a given transaction without taking into account whether it was LightX or not.

**Examples**
* LightX transaction just occurred:
    * confirmations: 5
    * bcconfirmations: 0
* LightX transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
    * confirmations: 6
    * bcconfirmations: 1
* non-LightX transaction just occurred:
    * confirmations: 0
    * bcconfirmations: 0
* non-LightX transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
    * confirmations: 1
    * bcconfirmations: 1
